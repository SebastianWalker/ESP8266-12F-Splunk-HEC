# ESP8266-12F-Splunk-HEC
![First Try](/Infos/Pictures/Breadboard%20Picture.png?raw=true "Prototype")

## The what and why...
### General
* This repository is just for me to learn how to use Github.
* This readme is just my personal note taking on my endeavour to learn. And so i have a place to review how i did this when i'm old.. :D

### Specific
* I have a few ESP8266-12F..
* I always wanted to use them for their wifi cababilities... didnt have a project/time so far.
* I am implementing Splunk at work. Learning on the go.. why not play with it at home too..
* I can run splunk in a docker on my QNAP NAS.. 
* I want to use Visual-Studio-Code and the PlatformIO plugin.

### Scope
* Everything i learn / do to get the ESP8266 to talk to Splunk on my NAS.
* Let's learn...Splunk, Docker, ESP8266, Markdown, ...

## Documentation
* [ESP8266 IoT Framework](https://github.com/maakbaas/esp8266-iot-framework)
* [QNAP Docker Splunk](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_8vvd1eB1JU5wbU0zWW05CGtKhPdAXr0pFtFbg6_nl4/edit#heading=h.c8ma5kq9d3ms)
  * SPLUNK_START_ARGS	--accept-license --name splunk
  * Docker is running in NAT mode.. that will change all port redirects on restart.. need to adjust the splunk-indexer port in ESP8266 every time

### Learnings?
* Difference in sending all sensor data in one event vs sending in batches (eg each sensor type as batch)?
  * NoBatch: i just named the sensor like BME280_temp..
  * Batch: just name the measurement Temperatur and have a sensor type as key:value
    * nope that didnt work out as expected.. sensor type didnt get in the index for each sensor.. jsut for the last in the batch
    * need to read the batching docu again maybe.. yeah. I tried to just send the event data. But it needs all the other information aswell.. also its stacked and so there is no `,`separator between the events curly braces.
* Event index vs Metric index
  * metric is faster for metrics ;) .. so they say

### Splunk and Docker
* [splunk.pid unreadable](https://community.splunk.com/t5/Security/splunk-starting-as-root-user-how-to-change-this-one/m-p/305432)
* due to Docker we can not use port 8088 for HEC.. it gets redirected from 32k-something to 8088 on the Docker container
* Docker (at least my container) runs in UTC. 
  * Sounds like best practise... but i am not located in UTC. Splunk HEC will use index time for time stamps, since in the HEC payload (eventdata, metadata) there is no timestamp configured. 
  * Need to figure out how to set the timezone for the source/host/sourcetype of my sensor in props.conf to match my timezone (especially how to do it on Docker...)

### IoT Framework 
* to change the config parameters and rebuild the web pages 
  * NPM needs to be installed (i guess u need to [install NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) / node.js frist)
   * open the `ESP8266 IoT Framework lib folder` (.pio/lipdeps/ESP8266 IoT Framework -> right click `open in integrated Terminal`) with vscode-terminal ()
   * in the new terminal window type `npm ci`
    * ~~open the project in `platformio cli terminal` and write `npm init` [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50895493/solving-the-npm-warn-saveerror-enoent-no-such-file-or-directory-open-users)~~
    * ~~use npm init -y to not be asked for any details~~
    * ~~`npm install`  [install NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)~~
    * ~~?npm install --save-dev webpack? [Link](https://webpack.js.org/guides/installation/)~~
  * add a .json file with the config parameters `iotFrameworkConfig.json` in the project root (wanted it in 'src' folder.. but that dind work.. maybe the buildflag was set wrong..)
  * add to platformio.ini: `build_flags = -DCONFIG_PATH=iotFrameworkConfig.json -DREBUILD_HTML -DREBUILD_CONFIG` to trigger the redbuild of the webinterface

### Hardware
* ESP8266 12F
* ~~DHT11 (Signal to D4, Resistor from VCC to signal)~~ dropped due to unreliable readings
* BME280 on I2C (temp, pressure, humidity)
* LED (D8, used for 1s heartbeat)
* LED (D5, used for PIR activity)
* LDR (A0 and VCC, Potentiometer to A0 to adjust the LDR reading)
* MAX44009 on I2C (ambient light sensor.. as improvement over the LDR solution)
* HC-SR04 (D6,D7 ultra sonic distance sensor)

### Problems
#### ESP8266 IoT Framework 
* After first changing the config parameters i struggeled to get it working for a 2nd project. But that was a case of RTFM. I tried to install npm and all that stuff in the project folder and not in the ESP8266 IoT Framework library folder. Anyways it is expalined in the manual.. just gotta read it..
#### DHT11
* This sensor (maybe just mine) is totally unrelaiable. Sometimes after restart it just reported numbers so far off the scale.. 150% humidity, -12Â°C temperature.. or returning NaN then a normal reading then off scale reading and so on...
#### Timezone and Docker
* The Docker container with splunk is running in UTC. And no matter what i set as my Timezone in Splunk web UI.. i only get my charts reporting in UTC. 
* Tried to set the TZ attribute in props.conf. No luck. Not for source, sourcetype or host.
* Well.. just giving up on Docker running Splunk on my NAS.. Getting Splunk on a dedicated machine and see how that works out.
#### Indextime vs Sensortime
* After i send the timestamp from the sensor (which is NTP synced) to splunk i noticed a time difference. The splunk HEC is using indextime since within the HEC json i do not specify the time in epoch (yet). Appearently it takes 15s to index or the docker container is not in sync..
* The time difference seems to getting worse over time... **insert picture**
* checking the time online and the `date`in docker over terminal.. the docker container is 18s in the future right now. That fits the 18s time difference between index and sensor time..
* Soooo...this is a docker problem... not a splunk one, nor a slow NAS :D
* [to fix it in the docker container](https://askubuntu.com/questions/342854/what-is-the-command-line-statement-for-changing-the-system-clock) (at least untill restart) i used `sudo date new_date_time_string` (format: MMDDhhmmyyyy.ss) MM=Month, DD=Day, hh=Hour, mm=Minute, yyyy=Year, ss=Second
#### Docker container restart
* After restart of the container the inputs didnt show up in splunk anymore. After debugging the Arduinos and any possible code change.. figured out it is Splunk. The HEC global setting for SSL was enabled again.. guess this setting doesnt persit a restart of the container. After disableing SSL.. the inputs were fine again.
